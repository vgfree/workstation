<li> Use a simple syntax similar to other object-oriented languages, or use traditional lua tables.<li> Define constructors and finalizers. Finalizers are called on garbage collection (also works in Lua 5.1 using newproxy).<li> Keywords such as as private, public, abstract, static, const and meta (to define in-class metamethods).<li> Multiple inheritance. Warns on ambiguous naming. Parent members are stored as direct references in children to keep things fast.<li> Define class namespaces using a dot separated class name. Import classes from other namespaces. Define aliases for your imported classes. Uses function environments.<li> A production mode config setting is included to speed up the library even more by disabling non-critical pieces of code.<li> Class data is precomputed during definition. Instantiation times are O(n) where n = number of class member, due to a simple deep copy of this data.<li> Namespaces are stored as nested global tables for easy access. Classes have common helper methods such as: get_name(), get_class(), instance_of().</UL>
